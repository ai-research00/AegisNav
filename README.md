## 🎯 What is AegisNav?

**AegisNav** is a complete, fully offline navigation system for Android smartphones that works without GPS, internet, or external services. It combines smartphone sensors (compass, gyroscope, accelerometer), offline maps, and augmented reality to guide users safely from point A to point B in any condition.

### Perfect For:
- 🚨 Emergency responders (disaster zones, no infrastructure)
- 🌍 Wilderness navigation (hiking, expeditions, mountains)
- 🛡️ High-security operations (contested regions, security-sensitive areas)
- 📡 GPS-denied environments (indoors, tunnels, urban canyons)
- 🔒 Privacy-conscious users (zero cloud services, zero tracking)

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Pre-Navigation
- User downloads map region (via WiFi)
- Calibrates compass (figure-eight motion)
- Selects destination on offline map

### 2. Navigation
- **Sensors**: Phone fusion (compass + gyroscope) keeps accurate heading
- **Routing**: Pre-computed routing graph finds optimal path
- **AR Overlay**: Camera shows direction arrow, landmarks, distance
- **Guidance**: Voice + text announces turns with landmark cues
- **Tracking**: Dead-reckoning estimates position between landmarks

### 3. Resilience
- If sensors drift: Automatic recalibration prompt
- If AR unavailable: Fallback to 2D map view
- If off-route: Automatic re-routing without GPS
- **Always offline**: No network needed, works in tunnels and basements
